  - name: beacon_chain__ez_withdrawals
    description: This convenience table contains information about the withdrawals made from the beacon chain, alongside address labels for analysis purposes. Withdrawal activity in this table is derived directly from the `withdrawals` object in the `eth_getBlockByNumber` Ethereum JSON-RPC Method, where block_number represents the block on Ethereum Mainnet and slot_number corresponds to the Beacon Chain slot that the withdrawal was executed in.
