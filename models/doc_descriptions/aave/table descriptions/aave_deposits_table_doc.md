{% docs aave_deposits_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_deposits contains transactions where users deposited into the Aave protocol. A user deposits their preferred asset and amount. After depositing, users earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, depositing allows users to borrow by using their deposited assets as a collateral. Any interest earned by depositing funds helps offset the interest rate accumulated by borrowing.
