{% docs aave_flashloans_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_flashloans contains flash loan transactions where a borrower executes an
undercollateralised, one-block liquidity loan. Flash loans are a feature designed for developers, due to the technical knowledge required to execute one. Flash Loans allow you to borrow any available amount of assets without providing any collateral, as long as the liquidity is returned to the protocol within one block transaction.
