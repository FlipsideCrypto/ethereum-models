{% docs aave_repayments_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_repayments contains transactions in which a borrower repays their loan (debt).  Loans are repaid in the same asset borrowed, plus accrued interest. Borrowers can also use their collateral to repay in version 2 of Aave Protocol. Borrowers can pay back their loan based on the USD price as they can borrow any of the available stable coins (USDC, DAI, USDT, etc.).
