{% docs aave_withdraws_table_doc %}

Aave.ez_withdraws contains transactions in which a user withdraws liquidity from the Aave protocol.  Users can use their â€œaTokens" as liquidity without withdrawing. They need to make sure there is enough liquidity (not borrowed) in order to withdraw, if this is not the case, users need to wait for more liquidity from depositors or borrowers repaying.
