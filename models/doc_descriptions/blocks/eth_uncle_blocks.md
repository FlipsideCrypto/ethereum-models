{% docs eth_uncle_blocks %}

[BETA TABLE] - Uncle blocks occur when two blocks are mined and broadcasted at the same time, with the same block number. The block validated across the most nodes will be added to the primary chain, and the other one becomes an uncle block. Miners do receive rewards for uncle blocks.
