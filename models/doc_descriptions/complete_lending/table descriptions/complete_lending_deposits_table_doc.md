defi.ez_lending_deposits contains deposit transactions across Aave, Compound, Spark, and Fraxlend protocols. A user deposits their preferred asset and amount. After depositing, users earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, depositing allows users to borrow by using their deposited assets as a collateral. Any interest earned by depositing funds helps offset the interest rate accumulated by borrowing.
