{% docs eth_ez_dex_swaps_table_doc %}

This table currently contains swap events from the ```fact_event_logs``` table for Uniswap V2, SushiSwap, and Curve, along with other helpful columns including an amount USD where possible. Other dexes coming soon! 
Note: A rule has been put in place to null out the amount_USD if that number is too divergent between amount_in_USD and amount_out_usd. This can happen for swaps of less liquid tokens during very high fluctuation of price.
