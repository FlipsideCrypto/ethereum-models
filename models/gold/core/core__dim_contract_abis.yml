      'This table contains the contract ABIs that we have sourced from Etherscan, the community, or bytecode matched. This table is the source of ABIs used in the `core__ez_decoded_event_logs` and `core__fact_decoded_event_logs` tables.
      We first try to source ABIs from Etherscan. If we cannot find an ABI on Etherscan, we will rely on user submissions. To add a contract to this table, please visit [here](https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/abi-requestor/).
      If we are unable to locate an ABI for a contract from Etherscan or the community, we will try to find an ABI to use by matching the contract bytecode to a known contract bytecode we do have an ABI for.'
