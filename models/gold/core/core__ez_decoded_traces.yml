    description: >
      This model contains decoded data for traces on the Ethereum blockchain. It will not contain all records, but only those for which we have a valid ABI.
      If you are interested in submitting a contract for decoding, please visit [here](https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/abi-requestor/).
