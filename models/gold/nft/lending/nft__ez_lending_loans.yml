    description: This table contains NFT lending events for loans backed by collateralized NFTs on Ethereum. For Blur's Blend, this could be depositing an NFT and taking out a loan or using the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) feature to take a loan out of the newly bought NFT. This NFT will remain locked until the loan is cleared.

      - name: EVENT_TYPE
        description: There are 2 types of loan creation events. It can either be a new loan or a refinance of an existing loan. Note that for NFTfi, renegotiation events are categorised as refinance events in this table. As for the refinancing feature on NFTfi, old loans are repaid and new loan ids are reissued so these would be new loan entries in this table. 
      - name: PLATFORM_ADDRESS
        description: The contract address of the platform's lending contract 
      - name: PLATFORM_NAME
        description: The name of the platform 
      - name: PLATFORM_EXCHANGE_VERSION
        description: The version of the platform's lending contract
      - name: LOAN_ID
        description: The ID associated with the loan, often times tied to the borrower's address and collateral. For the case of Blur's blend, this ID can be used as a unique identifier when tracking active loans. However, note that refinances can happen while still maintaining the same loanId. For platforms like NFTFI, loanids of previously paid loans are reused hence they can't be reliably used as a unique identifier without appropriate timestamp filters. Instead, use the unique_loan_id column. 
      - name: UNIQUE_LOAN_ID
        description: The unique ID that can be used to represent a loan within the same platform. For the same loan, the value of this ID will remain the same across the loans taken, liquidations and repayment tables. For some platforms like NFTFI where the lender is issued a promissory note, the lender can send this note to any address, making the receiver the new lender. However, the unique_loan_id still remains the same although the final lender is different. For Blend, unique_loan_id changes only if the loanId and lender changes which would also indicate the previous loan has been fully paid off. 
      - name: LENDER_ADDRESS 
        description: The address that gives out a loan to the borrower. In the case of NFTFI, when a loan is issued, a promissory note (an ERC721) is issued to the lender. The lender can transfer this note to any address which makes any receiving address the new "lender"
